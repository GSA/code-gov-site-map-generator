Code.gov is an open source project, so we invite your contributions, be it in the form of code, design, or ideas.

## Quick Setup Instructions
To run this app locally you'll need a code.gov API key.  If you don't have one, go to the following url to obtain one: https://developers.code.gov/key.html

Once you have an API key, clone the repo and run the `npm install` command in the project's root directory to install all of the projectâ€™s dependencies.

Run this terminal command: `cp env.example .env`

Replace `[your api key goes here]` in the `.env` file with your API key

Run the `npm run generate` terminal command to run the sitemap generation script.

There are more than 6000 projects currently in the project database. The API keys you get from [developers.code.gov](https://developers.code.gov/key.html) have a default result limit of 1000 projects. You'll need to get your result limit raised in order to return all projects in the database.
