## Setup instructions
To run this app locally you'll need a Code.gov API key. If you don't have one, go to the [https://developers.code.gov/key.html](https://developers.code.gov/key.html) to obtain one.

Once you have an API key, clone the repo and run the `npm install` command in the project's root directory to install all of the project’s dependencies.

Run `cp env.example .env` to create a template .env file in the root directory of the project 

Replace “[your api key goes here]” in the .env file with your API key

## Generating a new sitemap.xml

Run the `npm run generate` terminal command to run the sitemap generation script. Commit and push the new sitemap to a new branch. Submit a PR to merge this branch into master. After the PR is merged, run `git checkout master` and `git pull origin master` to update your local repository.

Then follow the instructions in the [Component Release Management](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/wiki/Component-release-management) wiki page of [`code-gov-front-end`](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end) to publish the new sitemap to npm. This step is required to ensure that code-gov-front-end consumes the latest version of this component.
